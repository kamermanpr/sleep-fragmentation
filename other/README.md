# Other effects of sleep fragmentation

This repository contains the analytical [data](./data/other.csv), [data analysis scripts](sleep-fragmentation-other.Rmd), and the [markdown document](sleep-fragmentation-other.md) and [figure](./figures/) outputs produced by the analysis scripts. The analysis shows summary plots, and the outputs of statistical analyses assessing the effects of two successive nights of sleep fragmentation on:  

1. Touch sensitivity using graded von Frey hairs before (assessing baseline sensitivity) and after (assessing whether ischaemia produced anaesthesia) forearm ischaemia;  
2. Pin-prick sensitivity using graded pin-prick intensities before ischaemia;  
3. Profile of Mood State (POMS) before and after each night of sleep;  
4. Pennebaker Inventory of Limbic Languidness (PILL) before and after of each night sleep _(these data are reported on here, but were not included in the manuscript because the value of the questionnaire was questionable)_;  
5. Sleep quality after each night of sleep (0-100mm VAS);  
6. Morning vigilance after each night of sleep (0-100mm VAS).
